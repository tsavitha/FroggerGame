RULES OF THE FROGGER GAME
=========================

The game surface has 2 rows of grass, 3 rows of stones and a row of water.

There are bugs running across the stone rows that are the enemies and a rock on one of the
stone rows that the player has to avoid.

The player starts with 3 lives.

The aim of the game is for the player to start on the grass rows, move one square at a time across
the stones using the up/down/left/right arrow keys on the keyboard, and get to the water without
being hit by the bugs or colliding with a rock.

The player looses a life everytime he hits a rock or bug.

When the player looses all 3 lives, he is prompted either to start a new game or quit.

The player gets 200 points everytime he reaches the water and and the game is reset to play again.

There are gems for extra points -
    Orange - 5 pts
    Blue - 15 pts
    Green - 25 pts
    Star - 50 pts
